In the United States, Support is provided from 8:00 AM through 6:00 PM (Central Standard Time) Monday through Friday, excluding United States public and bank holidays. Support shall consist of:

(a) Supplying telephone or other electronic support to Licensee in order to help (i) Licensee locate and, on its own, correct problems with the Products and (ii) provide product licensing assistance.

If Licensee has failed to renew or terminated its enrollment in Support, for a period of up to three years from the Support expiration date, Licensee may re-enroll in Support by paying a reinstatement fee to be calculated based on Licensor’s then current reinstatement policy and due for the period during which Licensee was not enrolled in Support.

For the avoidance of doubt, Support reinstatement will not be permitted after three years of lapsed Support. Licensee agrees not to modify the Product without the prior written approval of Licensor.

Any such change to Support shall not take effect until the completion of the then current support term.

6.5 SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES. Licensor is not required under this Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to Licensee. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If Licensee purchases support and Licensor provides Licensee with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the License and the terms of this Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement.
